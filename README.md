# FishSense

## Saving Scripts
To get the saving scripts, download the two .cpp files (requires librealsense to function properly)

## Postprocessing (Fish Identification Model 1 for RGB images)
To get the whole model, download all files labeled "Pretrained model using less colorful fish" into one repo.
For other recquired environments needed, contact me through zesun@ucsd.edu and I will send them to you
